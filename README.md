# Rama files
Hey, this is a repository that I use to store all of my website data. it is using Jsdelivr as a CDN service. This is to prevent multiple CDNs request, get the exact file, and generally make my code tidier. This is the exact file that I will be using.

### Contents:
* JS for stuff like jQuery, AOS, etc.
* CSS files for bootswatch, FA
* Other files.

### Usage:
use these link `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Ramacraft123/rama-files/any/directory/to-file.extension`

### Features:
* all of the features of JsDelivr: four CDN & two DNS providers, more than 750 points of presence, RUM based load balancing, faster than any other CDN, failover on every layer, works in China. That's why I choose JsDelivr
* Easy to use, just follow the usage.
* Zero downtime
